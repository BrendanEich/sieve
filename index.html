     * isMersenne(p) :: Prime -> Boolean
     * isMersenne p = (p & (p + 1)) == 0
     *
     * Return true if p is a Mersenne prime, false otherwise. A prime number p
     * is called a Mersenne prime (after Marin Mersenne (1588-1648), a Friar in
     * 17th Century France) if p+1 is a power of two.
     *
     * !!! Skip this whole comment until later, it's a very advanced topic !!!
     *
     * We use a trick of machine arithmetic and bitwise logic here: the binary
     * operator & takes two 32 bit integers and masks them together, so that
     * each bit in the result is set if and only if both corresponding bits in
     * the operands are set.
     *
     * Let's prove this function correctly returns true only if p+1 is a power
     * of two, and false otherwise. We will use induction, starting from basis
     * case p = 2, since 0 and 1 are neither prime nor composite, and showing a
     * few successive cases:
     *
     * p = 2: (2 & 3) = (010 & 011) = 2 => false, 2 is not a Mersenne prime
     * p = 3: (3 & 4) = (011 & 100) = 0 => true,  3 is a Mersenne prime
     * p = 5: (5 & 6) = (101 & 110) = 4 => false, 5 is not a Mersenne prime
     *
     * Note that a power of two in binary has the form ...1... where the ...
     * characters stand for zero or more 0 bits. E.g., 0001 binary is 1, 0010
     * binary is 2, 0100 binary is 4, etc.
     *
     * Now assume isMersenne(k) returns the correct result for some integer k.
     * To induct to isMersenne(k+1) we must consider two cases:
     *
     * 1. k is one less than a power of two greater than or equal to 2. Then k
     * in binary has the form ...01+++ where the ... stands for zero or more 0
     * bits and the +++ stands for zero or more 1 bits. Therefore k+1 in binary
     * is ...1...0 and by lining up the bits:
     *
     * ...01+++
     * ...1...0
     *
     * and masking along the columns according to the AND truth table:
     *
     * 0 & 0 => 0
     * 0 & 1 => 0
     * 1 & 0 => 0
     * 1 & 1 => 1
     *
     * we get
     *
     * ...0...0
     *
     * or just 0. Thus for this case, (k & (k + 1)) is 0. Note how this result
     * holds for k=1 and even k=0, even though neither 1 nor 0 is prime.
     *
     * 2. k is not one less than a power of two, yet k is still >= 2. Then k has
     * form ???1???0+++ where the ??? stand for zero or more bits of either 0 or
     * 1 value (and +++ and ... work as defined above).
     *
     * The smallest such k of ???1???0+++ form is 10 in binary or 2 in decimal.
     * Therefore k+1 has form ???1???1... and masking bits results in the form
     * ???1???0... which is non-zero due to the 1 bit in the middle. (Note by
     * the assumption that k is not one less than a power of two, there must be
     * at least one other 1 bit somewhere in k+1's binary form.)
     *
     * Therefore (k & (k + 1)) == 0 implies (k + 1) is a power of two, so for a
     * known prime p, (p & (p + 1)) == 0 implies p is a Mersenne prime. Q.E.D.
